## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Password Hashing Algorithm**
```javascript
Algorithm: PBKDF2
Hash Function: SHA-256
Iterations: 100,000
Salt Length: 32 bytes (256 bits)
Output Length: 32 bytes (256 bits)
```

### **Session Security**
```javascript
Token Length: 32 bytes (256 bits)
Session Duration: 8 hours
Inactivity Timeout: 2 hours
Storage: localStorage (encrypted in production)
```

### **Account Lockout Policy**
```javascript
Max Failed Attempts: 5
Lockout Duration: 15 minutes
Tracking Window: 15 minutes
Reset on Success: Immediate
```

## 🧪 **Security Testing**

### **Test Scenarios**

#### **1. Password Security Tests**
- ✅ **Weak Password Rejection**: System rejects passwords that don't meet complexity requirements
- ✅ **Password Hashing**: All new passwords are properly hashed with PBKDF2
- ✅ **Migration Testing**: Existing plain text passwords are migrated to hashed format
- ✅ **Hash Verification**: Login works correctly with hashed passwords

#### **2. Session Management Tests**
- ✅ **Session Creation**: Secure sessions created on successful login
- ✅ **Session Validation**: Invalid/expired sessions properly rejected
- ✅ **Session Timeout**: Sessions expire after configured time periods
- ✅ **Session Cleanup**: Logout properly clears all session data

#### **3. Account Lockout Tests**
- ✅ **Failed Attempt Tracking**: System tracks failed login attempts
- ✅ **Account Lockout**: Account locks after 5 failed attempts
- ✅ **Lockout Duration**: Account remains locked for 15 minutes
- ✅ **Auto Unlock**: Account automatically unlocks after lockout period
- ✅ **Success Reset**: Failed attempts reset on successful login

### **Test Accounts for Security Testing**

| Account | Email | Password | Purpose |
|---------|-------|----------|---------|
| Developer | devmark@agp.com | try465 | Full access testing |
| Admin | adminmark@agp.com | try123 | Admin access testing |
| User | usermark@agp.com | try123 | Basic user testing |

### **Security Test Commands**

Open browser console and run these commands to test security features:

#### **Test Password Migration**
```javascript
// Check migration status
window.passwordMigration.isMigrationCompleted()

// Verify all passwords are hashed
window.passwordMigration.verifyMigration()

// Force migration (if needed)
await window.passwordMigration.runMigrationWithUI()
```

#### **Test Account Lockout**
```javascript
// Check if account is locked
window.securityService.isAccountLocked('test@example.com')

// Simulate failed attempts
window.securityService.recordFailedAttempt('test@example.com')

// Check failed attempts
window.securityService.failedAttempts
```

#### **Test Session Management**
```javascript
// Validate current session
window.securityService.validateSession()

// Clear session
window.securityService.clearSession()

// Generate new session token
window.securityService.generateSessionToken()
```

## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**

### **For Users**
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use passwords with at least 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
2. **Regular Logout**: Always log out when finished, especially on shared computers
3. **Secure Environment**: Only access the system from trusted devices and networks
4. **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious activity immediately

### **For Administrators**
1. **Monitor Failed Logins**: Regularly check for unusual failed login patterns
2. **Review User Accounts**: Periodically review user accounts and permissions
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep the system updated with latest security patches
4. **Backup Security**: Ensure security logs and user data are properly backed up

### **For Developers**
1. **Code Review**: All security-related code should be reviewed
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing before deployment
3. **Monitoring**: Implement proper logging and monitoring
4. **Updates**: Keep dependencies and security libraries updated

## 🔍 **Security Monitoring**

### **What to Monitor**
- Failed login attempts
- Account lockouts
- Session anomalies
- Password change requests
- Unusual access patterns

### **Security Logs**
The system maintains security logs in localStorage:
- `agp_failed_attempts`: Failed login attempt tracking
- `agp_locked_accounts`: Account lockout information
- `agp_session`: Current session data

### **Security Alerts**
Users receive notifications for:
- Account lockout warnings
- Successful login after failed attempts
- Session expiration warnings
- Security-related errors

## 🚀 **Future Security Enhancements**

### **Phase 5: Two-Factor Authentication (Planned)**
- SMS-based 2FA
- Email-based 2FA
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- Backup codes

### **Phase 6: Advanced Security (Planned)**
- Biometric authentication
- Device fingerprinting
- Geolocation validation
- Advanced threat detection

### **Phase 7: Compliance (Planned)**
- GDPR compliance features
- Data encryption at rest
- Audit trail export
- Privacy controls

## 📞 **Security Support**

### **Reporting Security Issues**
If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. Do not disclose publicly
2. Contact the development team immediately
3. Provide detailed information about the issue
4. Allow time for investigation and fix
